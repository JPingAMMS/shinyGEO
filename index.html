<title> shinyGEO - GEO dataset analysis using R shiny  </title> </head>

<h2> shinyGEO: a web-based application for performing differential expression and survival analysis on Gene Expression Omnibus datasets </h2>
<h3> Summary </h3>
<p> Analyzing gene expression and correlating phenotypic data is an important method to discover insights about disease outcomes
 and prognosis. There are currently several web-based tools designed to address these analyses but are limited in usability, 
 data pipeline access, and reproducibility. We describe an R Shiny web application, <i>shinyGEO</i>, that can download gene 
 expression data sets directly from the Gene Expression Omnibus, and perform differential expression and survival analysis across selected genes and probes.
<p>

<h3> Running shinyGEO </h3>
<i>shinyGEO</i> is available from any of the below sites:
<ul>
